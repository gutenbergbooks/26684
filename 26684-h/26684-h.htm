<h1><small>PIRACY OFF THE FLORIDA COAST AND ELSEWHERE</small></h1>

<div class="bq1"><span class="smcap">At</span> a stated meeting of the <span class="smcap">Massachusetts Historical
Society</span>, held in Boston on Thursday, February 9, 1911,
Dr. <span class="smcap">Samuel A. Green</span> presented the following paper:&mdash;</div>

<p>Few persons of the present day are aware how extensively
piracy prevailed two centuries ago. There was no part of the
high seas that was free from the depredation of roving robbers.
At times they threatened towns on the coast, and at others
they attacked ships on mid-ocean; and they seem to have followed
their lawless pursuits at will. When caught, there was
little delay in bringing them to trial and securing a conviction;
and trivial technicality in forms played no part in reaching
results. At times there were multiple executions, and in the
community there was no morbid sentimentality shown for the
miserable wretches. Not the least of their torture was sitting
in the meeting-house on the Sunday before execution and listening
to their own funeral sermons, when the minister told
them what they might expect in the next world if they got
their just dues. On June 30, 1704, six poor victims were hung,
on the Boston side of the Charles River bank, for piracy and
murder; and there was a great crowd to witness the tragedy.
Among the spectators on this occasion was Chief-Justice Sewall,
one of the judges of the Admiralty Court which had convicted
the pirates, who did not think it beneath his dignity to be
present. It was then considered a public duty to invest the
scene of execution with as much awe as possible, and it was
thought that official station would emphasize this feeling.</p>

<p>The following extract from "The Boston News-Letter,"
August 21, 1721, shows how in early times piratical craft,
heavily manned and carrying many guns, sailed the high seas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and pursued their unlawful calling. The vessel was taken
somewhere in the Sargasso Sea, off the coast of Africa.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>These are to Certifie all Persons concerned that on the 7th Day
of May last, William Russel, Master of the Ship Mary of Charlstown,
in his Voyage from Madera to Surranam in the Lat. 22 Deg.
and 27 N. and Long. 25 and 27 W. from London was taken by a
Pirate Ship upwards of 50 Guns, Commanded by Capt. Roberts,
about 300 Men, who robb'd him of part of his Cargo, and Forced
away from him two of his Men, against his and their own consent,
viz. Thomas Russel born in Lexintown near Charlstown and the
other Thomas Winchol born in Portsmouth, New-Hampshire in
New England.</p></div>

<p>I have been led to make these introductory remarks on account
of a manuscript recently given to the Library by Mrs.
William B. Rogers, eldest daughter and sole surviving child of
Mr. James Savage, who was for more than sixty years a member
of this Society and for fourteen years its President. It consists
of an extract from a letter written by her uncle William Savage
to her father, dated at Havana, December 31, 1818, giving an
account of the capture by pirates of the ship <i>Emma Sophia</i>, off
the Florida coast, of which vessel he was supercargo. Since
the receipt of the paper from Mrs. Rogers I have found in the
"Boston Daily Advertiser," February 3, 1819, a fuller version
of the letter; and for that reason I here follow the copy as
given in the newspaper. Anything that relates to Mr. Savage
or his family will always be in order at these meetings. At
the unveiling of his bust in this room, on April 12, 1906, Mr.
Adams, the President, said that "with the single exception of
Mr. Winthrop no member of the Society since its beginning
has left upon it so deep and individual an impression" as
Mr. Savage has.</p>

<p>The account appears on the second page of the Advertiser,
under the heading of "Marine Journal," as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><big>MEMORANDA.</big></p>

<p>&#9758;The vessel mentioned in yesterday's paper, as having been plundered
off Florida, is the Hamburgh ship <i>Emma Sophia</i>, Capt. Frahm&mdash;the
supercargo is Mr. William Savage, of this town. It is stated
in the Charleston papers that she is insured at Lloyd's.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>We have been favoured with the following extract, giving further
particulars:</p>

<p><i>Extract of a letter from a gentleman of this town, supercargo of the
ship Emma Sophia, dated Havana, 31st Dec. 1818.</i></p>

<p>On Saturday 19th inst. between the Bahama Bank and Key Sal
Bank we were boarded and taken possession of by a small schr. of
about 30 tons, having one gun mounted on a pivot and 30 men. She
manned us with twelve men, Spaniards, French, Germans and
Americans, and carried us towards the Florida coast. Being arrived
on the coast nearly opposite to Havana, the privateer went in shore
to reconnoitre, and our ship lay off and on. Next morning she
returned with two small vessels, a schooner and sloop. We then
all four steered over the reef towards the small islands, and on
Tuesday afternoon were brought to anchor in a little harbour
formed by the Florida isles and the Martyr's Reef, as snug a hole as
buccaniers would wish. They had seen no papers, but those of the
ship and the Manifest, but the latter was enough, and they asked
not for invoices or bills of lading. As soon as we anchored, they
threw off our boats, took off the hatches and began to plunder the
cargo. They loaded their two small vessels and another that came
in next morning, besides taking our valuables on board the privateer.
Having filled their vessels with linens and nankins, we had still many
left, for our ship was full when we sailed from Hamburgh. Till
Wednesday noon, our cabin had been respected, but then they came
below and took packages of laces, gold watches from the trunks
and other valuable goods. Every man had a knife about a foot long,
which they brandished, swearing they would have money or something
more valuable, that was concealed, or they would kill every
soul of us, and they particularly threatened me. I appealed to their
captain, told him I was in fear of my life, and went with him on
board his privateer. He said he had no command, the crew would
do as they pleased, that I need entertain no fear of my life, but had
better tell at once if any thing was concealed. I told him there was
not. After my return to the ship towards night, the pirates left us
for the first time, and we hoped they had done with us. But next
morning another sch'r and sloop appeared in the offing, and the
privateer and one of the loaded sloops went out to meet them.
They all returned together, the privateer anchored, and a boat's
crew came towards us. I attempted to go on board the privateer
to see her captain, but was ordered back. When they came on
board, they said they had come to find where the gold &amp;c. was,
and that if we would not tell, they would hang every man of us and
burn the ship. Davis, the spokesman, drew his knife and swore,
that every man should die, unless he found the money, and first he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
would hang the supercargo. He called for a rope, which he had
brought on board, fitted with a hangman's noose, sent a man up
to the mizen yard and rove it and brought the noose down&mdash;and
one man held it, and another stood ready to hoist. Now, said Davis,
tell me where is the money, where are your diamonds, or I will
hang you this minute. In vain I repeated I had nothing more but
my watch, which I offered and he refused.&mdash;Once more, said he,
will you tell? I have nothing to tell, said I. On with the rope,
said the villain, and hoist away. The fellow with the noose came
towards me, and I sprang overboard. They took me up, after some
time, apparently insensible. They took off all my cloaths, and laid
me on my back on deck, naked as I was born, except having a blanket
thrown over me. Here I laid five hours without moving hand or
foot. Meanwhile they robbed us of every thing of the least value.
Against me they seemed to have a particular spite, stealing even the
ring from my finger, and all my cloaths from my trunks which they
sent on board the privateer.</p>

<p>At night they left us, but returned once or twice, for a few minutes,
to see how I was. That night the privateer, with two or three of
her convoy went to sea, and next morning, Christmas day, we got
under way.&mdash;Having taken good notice of the courses steered in
coming in, and keeping the lead constantly going, we found our
way out to <i>blue water</i> without much difficulty, and next morning,
26th, arrived without further accident at Havana.</p>

<p>The privateer was, I think, fitted out from this island. The
Captain is a Spaniard, a short man with a remarkable good face, that
nobody would suspect to belong to such a gang. The Lieutenant is
a Frenchman, a creole of St. Domingo, but called himself an Italian.
The man they called Davis, who ordered me to be hanged, is the
pilot or sailing master, and their boarding officer. He is an American,
belongs to New-York, and was the worst man on board. He
is a good looking fellow, something perhaps over the middle size,
but the most brutal rascal I ever met. There was another American
on board, only a common hand, being a drunkard.&mdash;Two negroes
are all the residue of the gentlemen with whom I had much acquaintance.</p>

<p>The goods taken from us were upwards of fifty thousand dollars
worth, and I have no doubt are landed on the coast of this Island.
The neighborhood of Cuba will be troubled waters until our government
shall seriously determine to put down this system of piracy.</p></div>

<p>Akin to this subject it may be proper to record an incident
which many years ago concerned myself, and might have been
tragical in its result. In the month of February, 1854, it fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to my lot to sail out of Boston harbor for Malta, aboard the
bark <i>Sylph</i>, of Liverpool, Nova Scotia. At that period vessels
sailing under the English flag were known in this country as
<i>lime-juicers</i>, so called because in the British navy the consumption
of lime or lemon juice was enforced as an anti-scorbutic
remedy. The only other passenger beside myself was Gen.
William A. Aiken, now of Norwich, Connecticut. The vessel
was in command of Captain Roberts, of Liverpool; and the
first officer was Mr. Hicks, and the second officer, Mr. Wharton.
According to my recollection there were eight in the forecastle,
which number, together with the cook and steward, made up
a complement of fourteen persons, all told, aboard the bark.
The cook and steward were represented by a single person of
African descent, who prided himself both on his hair and his
cooking, as well as on his brotherly kinship to the self-styled
rival of Jenny Lind, who was then called the "Black Swan"
(Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield), a singer, well-known in her day.
His hair deserves a word of special note, as it was sometimes
closely associated with his cooking, inasmuch as its elaborate
dressing was done before a glass hanging just beside a stove
in the cook's galley. He generally kept his long wool tightly
furled in numerous curling papers that stood out from his head
like spikes. On great occasions, such as Sundays and wonderful
deliverances from storms, he used to unfurl his kinky locks
which seemed ample enough then to fill a bushel basket.</p>

<p>After a delay of a week or ten days in the harbor, owing to
head winds or inclement weather we set sail; and I remember
well that the pilot, Fowler by name, as he was about to leave
the vessel, throwing his leg over the bulwarks, said in his
gruff voice to our skipper, "I will give you twenty-eight days
to the Straits."</p>

<p>There is little to write about the trip on the Atlantic side of
the voyage more than it was very monotonous, so much so that
both Aiken and myself for some slight relief used occasionally
to help the captain "take the sun" at noon, and in this way we
both became more or less expert in navigation. It was also
interesting to watch the sailors in their various duties and
pleasures; and from them we learned to splice ropes and to
tie fancy knots. We learned, too, the words of command in
proper sequence, as given by the captain, when he ordered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the men to tack ship or to wear ship, all which was of great
interest to us. Occasionally in good weather we used to take
our trick at the wheel in order to break the monotony of the
voyage. Sometimes we would catch a porpoise, of which
the liver would give us a taste of fresh meat and remind us of
home. Off Cape Trafalgar we sailed over the waters which
floated the English fleet when Nelson fought his famous fight.
I recollect the first glimpse we had of Cape Spartel, a point
of land in the northwest corner of the African continent,
overlooking the Straits, which we made early in the morning of
March 16, my birthday. With a head-wind it took two days
to beat into the Mediterranean, where we had many calms
and much bad weather. At one time we came near being
wrecked in a gale off Cape de Gato on the southern coast of
Spain, but generally we were cruising along the north coast
of Africa, within a few leagues of land, as our sailing course
was dependent upon the wind. At times we could see buildings
and villages on the shore, and then would sink them
behind as we sailed away.</p>

<p>The incident to which I have already alluded, occurred in the
latter part of March, off Cape Tres Forcas on the Barbary
Coast. One afternoon, as we were sailing along at low speed
with little wind, two or three leagues from land, we spied
two lateen-rigged feluccas, apparently following us, which at
first sight attracted but little attention. Captain Roberts soon
became suspicious of their movements and watched them
closely, as they were gaining on us. We were going hardly more
than two or three knots an hour, having little more than steering
way, but they spreading much sail were faster. The
captain soon gave orders to have an inventory taken of the
firearms on board that could be used in case of need, but
these were found to be few in number and in poor condition.
The cook was ordered to heat as much boiling water as his
small galley would allow, to be ready to repel any attempt to
board the vessel. There was great excitement on the bark,
and we fully expected to be attacked, but fortunately for us</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">The shades of night were falling fast,<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="noin">and soon the sun went down. We then changed our course a
point or two and threw a sail over the binnacle light so that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
suspected pirates could not follow us; and thus we escaped
what might have been a tragedy.</p>

<p>After our arrival at Malta we learned that three vessels had
been taken by the Riff pirates, as they were called, near the
time when we were threatened, and near the same point of land.
Without doubt the captors belonged to the same crew as those
that followed us. We were on the Mediterranean Sea at the
time when the Crimean War broke out, England having declared
war on March 28. This new condition of public affairs
caused great confusion in the movement of steamers and in
transportation generally, as steamships were much needed for
military purposes; on which account my stay at Malta was
somewhat prolonged. During this time I saw a good deal of
the American consul, Mr. William Winthrop, who was a kinsman
of our former President, Mr. Winthrop, and at a later
period a Corresponding Member of this Society. At the regular
monthly meeting held on November 8, 1882, Mr. Robert C.
Winthrop, Jr., paid a handsome tribute to the consul, on the
occasion of the Society's receiving a liberal bequest from him.
He ended his remarks by saying of him: "He took a pride,
however, in being a Corresponding Member,&mdash;the only one
in nearly a century who, so far as I am aware, ever left the
Society a dollar, and I much fear that, in this respect, he is
likely long to remain unique."</p>
